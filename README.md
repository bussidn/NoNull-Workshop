# NoNull-Workshop
Worshop to learn how to not use the keyword "null" anymore

You and your team are in charge of a small service application.
The business it does will be abstract.

Your application is composed of multiple services.
For simplicity, each service will be represented by a name and a function going from a type A to a type B.
It means that serviceAB will be a function going from A to B :

```java

B serviceAB(A a);

```
We will represent such a service like this :

serviceAB : A -> B
